//! # credence-risk-core
//!
//! The single source of truth for Credence Finance risk math (Build Guide §8.9.3, §9).
//!
//! One crate, two builds: it compiles to WASM inside the Stylus Risk Engine and natively for the keeper,
//! `risk-cli`, calibration and UI previews. Both builds run the same integer code, so their outputs are
//! bit-identical. There is no floating point anywhere.
//!
//! Units follow §7.1: loan amounts in loan-token base units, collateral in token base units, prices and ratios
//! in WAD (1e18), standardised scenario gaps `z` as `i16` thousandths of one σ.
//! Rounding follows §7.2: always against the user who is acting, never against solvency. Every function
//! documents its direction.
